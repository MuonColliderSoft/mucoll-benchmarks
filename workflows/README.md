# Purpose-specific workflows

Each workflow comprises of two components:
* the main workflow script `workflow.sh` that calls sequentially all the relevant stages: `generation`, ..., `plotting`;
* supporting configuration files for the generic `analysis` and `plotting` scripts tailored to the specific workflow.
